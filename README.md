# Data-Mining-Project-Occupancy_Detection
Collection of python notebook a group project in data mining, 
exploring advanced techniques such as classification, neural network, clustering, regressors, forecasting, and more...

The goal is to predict the room occupancy using experimental data 
from Temperature,Humidity,Light and CO2.
